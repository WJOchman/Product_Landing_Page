<p>The product chosen for this project will be three different storm trooper helments from Star Wars. The prices for the helmets will be entirely made up. Disclaimer, I do not own any of the artwork and or rights over the concepts to these helments. I am just using them because I love Star Wars, love clone troopers, and was out of fun ideas for what 'product' to use for this project.</p>
